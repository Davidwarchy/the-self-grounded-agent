- Get embeddings, cluster them. Plot corresponding lidars of each clusters in a diagram. 
- - option to only get lidar readings that are a given temporal distance apart (to show that even temporarily distant places collapse into a similar embedding)
- Get embeddings, cluster them. Plot a cluster on the map 
- Take embeddings, convert to 3d pca, then rgb. Plot in diagram 
- Take embeddings, but just those within a given orientation, convert to 3d pca, then rgb. Plot in diagram 
- Correlations between features (full embeddings or pca-reduced) with human-intuition of distance to wall, openness, turn intensity 


- Option to save as pdf 
- Option to sample the embeddings in case they are many 
- Option to show arrows (including scale of arrow)
