Now let's do some associative experiments... 
We have a fixed table of perceptiosn - number of levels ** number of pixels (eg 3**3 = 27)
We want to do some experiment right now

We want to do some random association between percetions and actions... so that we have various combinations for certain actions... 

We might want to add noise (or something; advise here and let's see). Or let's just start with noiseless... 

Then do the walk

Save outputs to output/associated
