# Robot Exploration Environment

A Gym-like environment for a robot navigating a 2D map with lidar sensors, focused on map exploration.

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the environment:
   ```bash
   python robot_env.py
   ```

## Directory Structure
- `robot_env.py`: Main file containing `RobotExplorationEnv` class.
- `utils/`: Utility modules for lidar calculations and map/robot creation.
- `output/`: Stores simulation data in timestamped directories.

## Usage
- Run `python robot_env.py` to simulate the robot with a random policy.
- The environment generates data in `output/<timestamp>/` (paths, lidar, actions).
- The environment provides:
  - **Action space**: Discrete (0: forward, 1: back, 2: left, 3: right).
  - **Observation space**: Array of lidar distances (100 rays).
  - **Reward**: Number of new cells mapped.
  - **Done**: Max steps (1M) reached or 99% map coverage achieved.
